# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is kind of like a place holder inside a function, and once you console.log call on the function, you will use an arguement to put into the spot of the parameter

Researched answer: A parameter is a place holder variable that is is in the parenthesis of a function. it is later assigned a value, which is an arguement. it is passed to the parameter that was inside the parenthesis of the function, and the output will change based on the input.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The predefined parameters are built in methods in higher order functions. The higher order functions can take more than one arguement.

Researched answer: THe predefined parameters are value, index, and array. The value of the array is required; while index and array are optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: Map is a method inside the function that will bring back the same length of the original array (for example, great for modifying an array with multiplcation). filter will filter through the array and bring back what its supposed to bring back (for example, you can filter through an array of numbers and bring back odd numbers)

Researched answer: Map is used to create a new array with with the same length, once it has been manipulated however desired (for example, bringing back a new array of numbers from an original array multiplied by 3). The elements can be changed however you set the function to do so. Filter will create an array that can be a different length than the original array, it returns the elements that your function has been set to bring forward (for example, even or odd numbers). 


4. What is iteration?

Your answer: iteration is the process of looping through a function until to bring backa particular return.

Researched answer: Iteration is used when you want to loop a functionality repeatedly, in a predetermined amount of loops. If you wanted something to loop five times, you would use a for loop to iterate a function to loop 5 times


5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: An object is a collection of data that stores keys, while a class acts like a blueprint for an object. 

Researched answer: Objects are a data type that has collections of key value pairs. Objects are like an intersection of data and behavior. Classes are a type of function that contain data and behavior. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: what a user can see on a website (header, footer etc)

2. Spread operator:

3. React: a library used to build webpages, mobile pages, and native mobile apps. it is used to build small parts, and then join them together to form a bigger thing (webpage, app)

4. React props:ngive us ability to communicate between components by passing data and behavior from one component to a nested component

5. DOM events: something that allows you yo register event handlers on elements in functions. the function wont be executed before the event occurs (clicking a button, maybe hovering over something on a website can be a dom event that causes something to display on the screen etc)
